================================================

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Explanation of the script: 
*loads necessary packages 

*reads in features data 

*creates logical vector: TRUE, if feature contains mean/std, else false 

*reads in X_train and y_train datasets 

*adds features as column names in x_train 

*extracts columns that are needed (mean, standard deviation) in x_train 

*loads activity labels 

*adds activity labels as factors to y_train 

*adds activity labels (colnames) to y_train #adds subject label to subject_train

*binds y_train and x_train together as data.table



*Does the same thing with test data: #reads in X_test and y_test dataset:

*adds features as column names in x_test 

*extracts colums that are needed (mean, standard deviation) in x_test 

*adds labels as factors to y_test 

*adds activity (colnames) labels to y_test 

*adds label to subject_test #cbinds y_test and x_test together as data.table 

*rbinds data_test and data_train together

*creates a vector which contains variables to keep not to split apart on 

*melts the data to make a tidy dataset, creates tidy_data.txt 

*makes tidy_data which with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, creates tidy_mean_data.txt
